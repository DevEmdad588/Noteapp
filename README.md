# NoteApp - ListView Demo

This simple Android project demonstrates how to use a ListView to display a set of data.

## Features

* Displays a list of notes using a ListView.
* Each note item shows a title and a timestamp.
* Data is stored in a simple data structure (e.g., an ArrayList).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app.

## How it Works

1. **Data:** The app creates a list of `Note` objects, each containing a title and a timestamp.
2. **Adapter:** A custom adapter (`NoteAdapter`) is created to handle the display of note items in the ListView.
3. **ListView:** The ListView is populated with the data using the adapter.
4. **Display:** The app displays the list of notes on the screen.

## Code Overview* 
**`MainActivity.kt`:** Contains the main logic for creating the data, setting up the adapter, and displaying the ListView.
* **`Note.kt`:** Represents a single note item with a title and timestamp.
* **`NoteAdapter.kt`:** A custom adapter that handles the display of note items in the ListView.
* **`activity_main.xml`:** Defines the layout of the main activity, including the ListView.

## Limitations

* This is a basic demo and does not include features like saving notes to persistent storage or editing existing notes.
* The data structure used is simple and might not be suitable for large datasets.

## Future Enhancements

* Add functionality to save and load notes from a database or file.
* Implement note editing and deletion.
* Improve the UI and add more features.
